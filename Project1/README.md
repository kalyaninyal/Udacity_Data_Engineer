Introduction

A startup called Sparkify want to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

The aim is to create a Postgres Database Schema and ETL pipeline to optimize queries for song play analysis.

Project Description

In this project, I have to model data with Postgres and build and ETL pipeline using Python. On the database side, I have to define fact and dimension tables for a Star Schema for a specific focus. On the other hand, ETL pipeline would transfer data from files located in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL

Schema for Song Play Analysis

Fact Table

songplays records in log data associated with song plays

Dimension Tables

users in the app

songs in music database

artists in music database

time: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

Project Design

Database Design is very optimized because with a ew number of tables and doing specific join, we can get the most information and do analysis

ETL Design is also simplified have to read json files and parse accordingly to store the tables into specific columns and proper formatting

Database Script

Writing "python create_tables.py" command in terminal, it is easier to create and recreate tables

Jupyter Notebook

etl.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook is given for verifying each command and data as well and then using those statements and copying into etl.py and running it into terminal using "python etl.py" and then running test.ipynb to see whether data has been loaded in all the tables

Relevant Files Provided

test.ipnb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database

create_tables.py drops and created your table

etl.ipynb read and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads into your tables in Jupyter notebook

etl.ipynb read and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads into your tables in ET

sql_queries.py containg all your sql queries and in imported into the last three files above
